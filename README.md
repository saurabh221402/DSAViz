# DSAViz 
*  A Data Structure and Algorithm (DSA) visualizer is a web application that helps visualize the workings of various data structures and algorithms.
  This tools are beneficial for learning and understanding how data structures and algorithms operate through graphical representations and animations.

## Benefits of DSAViz
* Intractive Learning
  - Visual Feedback using color comcination.
  - step-by-step executions of algorithm.
    
* Education Tool
  - Self-learning : It allows learners to experiment with and explore different algorithms and data structures at their own pace.
  - Teacher-aid : It allow them to demostrate the algorithm in very intutive way .
    
* Boost Enagement level & better understanding

## Features of DSAViz
* Support for Various Data Structures & Algorithms:
  - Sorting Algorithms (bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, quick sort ...)
  - Searching Algorithms (D.F.S, B.F.S, Binary search ...)
  - Graph Implementation
  - Tries Implementation
  - It also provide visualisation of various complem coding problems
  - many more to come ...

* Controlling Feature:
  - Adjustable Speed: For controlling the speed of animations.
  - Input Fields: To allow users to input data or modify parameters.
  - Control Buttons: For starting, pausing, or stepping through the algorithm.

* Educational Content:
  - Suggest best content related to each individual topic from vaious Educatoinal platforms.

## Future Scope
* DSAViz expand by adding feature which help individual to understand & solve various coding problem with DSAViz.
* Collaborate with various Educational Institutes and platforms
